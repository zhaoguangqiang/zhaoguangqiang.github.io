Hi, I am Chih-Hsuan Kuo (a.k.a. KuoE0 / Tommy Kuo). I'm working for Mozilla for Gecko (the browser engine of Firefox) development. I live in Taiwan (an independent country).

[Harmono](https://github.com/kuoe0/harmono) is based on [Harmony](https://github.com/gayanvirajith/harmony), the template created by [Gayan Virajith](https://github.com/gayanvirajith). Thank for his great template. [Harmony](https://github.com/gayanvirajith/harmony) is the most elegant template I found. I love it and add some features for me.
